A case-study-first portfolio theme for Astro. Designed for professionals who want to showcase their thinking, decisions, and real impact—not just screenshots and tech stacks.

## Why Case?

Most portfolio themes focus on listing projects with screenshots and bullet points. Case takes a different approach: it treats every project as a case study with a structured narrative—problem, constraints, approach, key decisions, and measurable outcomes.

This lets you demonstrate not just what you built, but how you think. Hiring managers and clients see your decision-making process, trade-offs you considered, and the real impact of your work. You stand out by showing depth, not just breadth.
